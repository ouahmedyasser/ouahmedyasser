# Hi there!

## 📙 Introduction

Hello there! My name is Yasser and I like programming. I was born in 2007. I'm a curious person that usually keeps his curiosity inside him and then search for it online. All I want is to achieve my dreams and find the success in this world. I speak English and I love that language so much. That's all I guess.

### 👾 Hobbies and Interests

I would like to start mentioning my hobbies first:

- **💻 Writing codes and programming.** Well, I think this one is obvious. 😁
- **📖 Learning new things that I'm interested on.** Specially in my free time.
- **🧮 Doing mathematics.** Perhaps, you may find this hobby weird to have. However, it's true.
- **📺 Creating contents.** I don't consider myself very good on this but I like to edit the videos I recorded and I also make simple thumbnails or pictures.
- **🎮 Gaming.** I usually do not play video games but I'd like to do it with friends, to free my mind, or for YouTube.
- **🎵 Listening to songs.**  

*I have other hobbies. Yet, I would like to keep them secret until you get to know me better!*

Now, let's start talking about my interests:

- **📘 Mathematics:** I'm interested in learning Topologies, Algebraic geometry, Lie Algebra, and more. In addition, I'd like to level up to Advanced Calculus.
- **🔌 Electrical engineering:** This is another thing that I do not learn in school but I'd like to be taught about it. Maybe, I will build something that is electric in future?
- **🧪 Chemistry:** Chemistry is cool. I think everything on it is interesting.
- **🍎 Physics:** Relativity, Fluid, Quantum Physics, and Thermodynamics are all just interesting for me. 
- **💻 Computer Science:** I always found this world interesting. I like everything on it.
- **🚀 Rocket Science:** I'm planning to learn rocket science and its branches for fun and perhaps to build a rocket in future?
- **🎞️ Animation:** Unfortunately, I couldn't even start on this. I understand that animating takes a lot of time and it's hard to do but I may try it one day.


 <u>**🏫 Favorite School Subjects:**</u>

> ♾️ Mathematics, ⚛️ Physics, 🌎 English

Anyways, I consider myself lifelong learner. I do not really learn many stuff for school grades. I'm just interested in these topics.

### 🌐 Social Media

I do have a variety of social media. However, I'd like to only share main accounts related to this GitHub profile. 

- **Instagram:** [@ouahmed.yasser](https://www.instagram.com/ouahmed.yasser/)

I'm usually offline in many platforms because I think social media are waste of precious time unless if it's used correctly.
